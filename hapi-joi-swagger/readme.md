# Example of auto-generated documentation using `TS + Hapi + Joi + Swagger`

Routes logic (handling, validation etc.) are in `routes/*/index.ts` files.

Generated documentation can be accessed through the interface available by `/documentation` route.

 - Install dependencies: `npm i`;
 - Run the server: `npm run run`;
 - Go to `http://localhost:3000/documentation`;
 - Try to change routes in file `routes/users/index.ts` and re-launch the server;
 - See what changed in the documentation.
